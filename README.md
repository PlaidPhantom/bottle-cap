Lightweight Python3-compatible SQLite-based authentication framework for Bottle web applications

I built this because [Cork](https://github.com/FedericoCeratto/bottle-cork) did not (at the time) support Python 3. That seems to have been
remedied recently, but perhaps someone will still find this useful.  Feel free to make suggestions/pull requests/issues
and I'll look into them as I can!


## Depends on:

* [Bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle)
* [Cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography)
