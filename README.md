# bottle-cap

Lightweight Python3-compatible SQLite-based authentication framework for Bottle web applications

I built this because FedericoCeratto/bottle-cork did not -- at the time -- support Python 3. That seems to have been
remedied recently, but perhaps someone will still find this useful.  Feel free to make suggestions/pull requests/issues
and I'll look into them as I can!


## Depends on:

* bottlepy/bottle
* pyca/cryptography
